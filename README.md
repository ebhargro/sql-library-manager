# sql-library-manager
In this project, I have been tasked with creating an application for my local library to help them manage their collection of books. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data manually. This application will provide a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.

For this project, I have built a web application that includes pages to list, add, update, and delete books by implementing a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
